# Customer Segmentation for Retail Banking

## Project Overview  
This project performs customer segmentation analysis for a retail banking dataset using KMeans clustering and PCA for visualization. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on demographic and financial behavior to help the bank tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

The dataset includes the following features:  
- Gender  
- Age  
- Education  
- Marital Status  
- Annual Income (k$)  
- Spending Score (1-100)  

## Methods  
- Data preprocessing: cleaning, scaling numerical features, one-hot encoding categorical variables  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): distribution plots and summary statistics  
- Clustering: KMeans algorithm with the Elbow method to select the optimal number of clusters  
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA for 2D visualization of clusters  
- Insight generation and strategic recommendations based on clusters
